# Obstacle_circumvent_robot
the project was proposed on the interest of man kind towards space exploration. 
An obstacle circumvent is made with an wide lasting technological subject called Arduinoâ€™s .
It is a robot which simulates a rover which avoids obstacles in its path and changes its motion direction to where no obstacle is found. 
It is done with the help of a control board called the Arduino UNO which controls three essential hardware drivers say- the servo motor, the Ultrasonic sensors and the bo-motors.
This controller is supported by a 18650 li-ion battery and a power bank of 2500mAh and can also be recharged. 
The input is taken from the Ultrasonic sensors which calculates the distance and based on its calculation the Arduino UNO produces the output.
Using this principle we can apply this application in major projects like autopilot in Tesla cars etc.
